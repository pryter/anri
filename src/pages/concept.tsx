        My father is from Songkhla, the southern part of Thailand and my mother
        is from Meguro, Tokyo. Being a half Thai-Japanese living in Bangkok, my
        parents would take me back to visit my grandparents, in two different
        places, every year since I was little. I always feel amazed about how
        different these towns are, from people, color schemes, weather, nature,
        buildings, food, noises or even smell. It is crazy to think that my
        parents grew up in such completely different environment but still
        somehow met each other across the country and brought me to the world.

        In this project, I experimented the photography that I took from both
        places by comparing each of the different scenes. These photography
        portray how I view my “two homes”, and depict the feelings of what is it
        like to have two cultures influencing every part of who I am.{" "}
